I got the idea for this project when the time my family and I ate dinner kept having
to account for my brother having enough time to get his lineups in before 
the football games started at 7pm. I saw what my brother was doing one day, 
flipping through multiple NFL statistics sites and copying and pasting data
into a spreadsheet, which regularily took over 3 hours, and thought "I can
make this". Hence the NFL scaper.
