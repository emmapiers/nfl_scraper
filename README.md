I got the idea for this project when my family's dinner time kept having
to account for my brother having enough time to get his lineups in before 
the football games started at 7pm. I saw what my brother was doing one day, 
flipping through multiple NFL statistics sites and copying and pasting data
into a spreadsheet, which regularily took over 3 hours, and thought "I can
make this". Hence the NFL scaper.
